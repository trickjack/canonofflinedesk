- Unstable or disconnected Wi-Fi network
- Loose or faulty USB connections
- Paused or stuck print queues
- Outdated, missing, or corrupt printer drivers
- Incorrect printer status or default printer settings
- Firmware or software glitches

Recognizing these causes makes it easier to troubleshoot the issue quickly.
